# BBS Telnet Terminal

A retro Telnet terminal application for connecting to BBS systems. This project provides both a desktop UI (using Tkinter) and a web-based UI (HTML/JavaScript) to interact with a BBS server. It includes features such as:

- **Connection Settings:** Connect/disconnect from the BBS.
- **Username/Password Handling:** Send and optionally remember credentials.
- **Chatlog:** Save and review chat messages locally.
- **Triggers:** Create automation triggers to send custom responses when certain text appears.
- **Favorites:** Manage favorite BBS addresses.
- **Chatroom Members Panel:** View active members.
- **Live URL Previews:** Hyperlink detection with live preview thumbnails (web UI).

## Setup Instructions

### Python Virtual Environment (Windows/PowerShell)

1. **Download and Install Python:**
   - Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.
   - Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".

2. **Open PowerShell:**
   - Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" from the menu.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```
   - Replace `path\to\your\project` with the actual path to the folder where you saved the project files.

4. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv venv
     ```

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - If you get a script execution policy error, type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
     ```
   - Then, try activating the virtual environment again.

6. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Running the Desktop Application

1. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2. **Run the main Python script:**
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```powershell
     python main.py
     ```
3. The desktop window (Tkinter UI) should open, displaying connection settings, chat output, input fields, and additional panels (chatlog, triggers, favorites, etc.).

---

## Running the Web UI

1. **Open the `ui.html` file:**
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved the project files.
   - Double-click on the `ui.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
2. The web UI displays various controls (Favorites, Triggers, Chatlog, etc.) along with a terminal-like output area.
3. Use the provided buttons and input fields to simulate or send messages.

## Usage

- **Connecting:**
  - Enter the BBS host and port in the connection settings, then click **Connect**. The **Connect** button will change to **Disconnect** when connected.

- **Username/Password:**
  - Use the Username and Password fields to send your credentials. You can enable “Remember” to store these locally.

- **Sending Messages:**
  - Type a message into the input field at the bottom. Press **Enter** to send. If the input is empty, an ENTER (newline) keystroke will be sent.

- **Triggers:**
  - Click the **Triggers** button to open a small window with 10 rows (2 columns: Trigger and Response). Fill in your automation pairs and click **Save**. When a message received in the terminal matches any trigger (case‑insensitive), the associated response is automatically sent.

- **Chatlog:**
  - Click the **Chatlog** button to view a chatlog window. The left pane lists users who have sent messages, and clicking a username displays their messages in the right pane. Use the **Clear** button to clear the log for the selected user.

- **Favorites:**
  - Use the **Favorites** button to manage and quickly select favorite BBS addresses.

- **Additional Controls:**
  - Options like **MUD Mode**, **Keep Alive**, and action buttons (Wave, Smile, Dance, Bow) are available to customize your experience.

- **Chatroom Members:**
  - The chat members panel (on the right side of the desktop app) shows active members.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Chat Messages Displayed:**
  - Ensure that your regex filters (in `process_data_chunk`) match the format of incoming messages. For public messages, the expected format is `From <username>: <message>` (or similar). Adjust the regex if needed.

- **Triggers Not Firing:**
  - Verify that your trigger strings exactly match parts of the incoming message (case-insensitive). You can test by manually injecting sample messages into the terminal.

- **UI Elements Not Visible:**
  - Do a hard refresh in your browser or restart the desktop app to ensure that the latest HTML/CSS/JS changes are loaded.

- **Connection Issues:**
  - Check that the BBS host and port are correct. Use debugging messages (printed to the console) to see connection status.
